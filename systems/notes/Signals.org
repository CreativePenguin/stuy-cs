#+title: Signal Handling
* Sending Mixed Signals
** Signal handling in c programs <signal.h>
- sighandler
- To intercept signals in a c program, you must create a signal 
handling function.
- Some signals (like SIGKILL, SIGSTOP) cannot be caught
#+BEGIN_SRC c
static void sighandler(int signo)
#+END_SRC
- Static values in c exist outside the normal call stack, 
they can be accessed regardless of the function on top
- For variables, this also means they retain their values even if
the function they are declared in has ended.
- Static variables (variables and functions) can only 
be accessed from within the file they are declared
#+BEGIN_SRC c
static void sighandler(int signo) {
  if(signo == SIGINT) prinf("haha! can't touch this!\n");
  if(signo == SIGSEV) printf("nothing to see here..\n");
}

int main() {
  signal(SIGINT, sighandler);
  signal(SIGSEGV, sighandler);
}
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC c
exit(0); exit(1); //Exits program, use exit(1) if error
#+END_SRC
