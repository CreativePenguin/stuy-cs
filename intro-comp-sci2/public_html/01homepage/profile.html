			Why did we make the word orange? That word is so confusing! Why is it both
			a fruit and a color? Did someone just look at a color, and decide to name
			a fruit based off of it? Who thinks that our collection of colors is a
			repository to go looking for a name for a fruit? What do those things have
			to do with one another? <br> Why does this persist in other languages too?
			Shouldn't there be a point where one person looks at the fruit, and goes:
			"this is stupid, why do we keep on doing this? Just because an orange is
			orange, doesn't mean we should call it that." How could we as a society
			screw this up that badly? I believe that this is enough reason to call
			a state of emergency in order to solve this crisis before it becomes a
			lost cause.

			Despite our robotics team being objectively the best club in the entirety
			of Stuyvesant, there are some things that we do that is probably less than
			ideal. For instance, we dab way too much for no reason. We have made
			our own dabbing emoji, and a picture of one of us dabbing got onto a news
			outlet in China. However, the reason why we do this is because we want to
			raise awareness for the cancer patients in Antartica.
