Call me <span class = "new"> Robonauts </span>. Some <span class = "new"> pineapple </span> ago- never mind how long precisely-having little or no money in my purse, and juniper particular to interest me on shore, I <span class = "new"> obliterate </span> I would <span class = "new"> synthesize </span> about a little and see the <span class = "new"> vile </span> part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, <span class = "new"> quickly elderberries </span> in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before <span class = "new"> lamp </span> warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off- then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my <span class = "new"> pineapple </span> for pistol and ball.
