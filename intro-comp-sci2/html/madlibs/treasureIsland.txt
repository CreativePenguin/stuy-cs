SQUIRE TRELAWNEY, $PROPERNOUN$, and the rest of these gentlemen having
asked me to write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island, from
the beginning to the end, $VERB$ nothing back but the bearings of the
island, and that only because there is still $NOUN$ not yet lifted, I
take up my $NOUN$ in the year of grace 17__ and go back to the time when
my father kept the Admiral Benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the
sabre cut first took up his lodging under our roof.

I remember him as if it were yesterday, as he came $VERB$ to the
inn door, his $NOUN$ following behind him in a hand-barrow--a
tall, strong, heavy, nut-brown man, his tarry pigtail falling over the
shoulder of his soiled blue coat, his hands ragged and scarred, with
black, $ADJECTIVE$ nails, and the sabre cut across one cheek, a dirty, livid
white. I remember him looking round the cover and whistling to himself
as he did so, and then $VERB$ out in that old sea-song that he sang so
often afterwards:

          "Fifteen men on the dead man's chest--
             Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!"

in the high, $ADJECTIVE$ tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and
broken at the capstan bars. Then he $VERB$ on the $NOUN$ with a bit of
stick like a handspike that he $VERB$, and when my father appeared,
called roughly for a glass of rum. This, when it was brought to him,
he drank $ADVERB$, like a connoisseur, lingering on the taste and still
looking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard.
