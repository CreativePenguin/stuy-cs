$NOUN$ wear the $NOUN$ that grins and lies,
   It hides our $NOUN$ and shades our eyes,â€”
   This debt we pay to human guile;
   With torn and $VERB$ hearts we smile,
   And mouth with $ADJECTIVE$ subtleties.

   Why should the world be over-wise,
   In counting all our $NOUN$ and sighs?
   Nay, let them only see us, while
           We wear the $NOUN$.

   We smile, but, O great Christ, our cries
   To thee from tortured souls arise.
   We sing, but oh the clay is vile
   Beneath our feet, and long the mile;
   But let the world dream otherwise,
           We wear the $NOUN$!
