- Define curves as system of equations in terms of an independent variable
- Think of t as a percentage. Think of a shape, and increase t based on how far along you are
## Line
(x0, y0) -> (x1, y1)  
```
         t=1
        .
       /
      /
t=0  /
    .
```
x = x0 + t(x1 - x0)  
## Circle
(Cx, Cy), r  
x = rcos(2pi * t) + Cx  
y = rsin(2pi * t) + Cy  
t=  0 - 1
