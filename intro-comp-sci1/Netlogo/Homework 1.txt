Things in the document that I strongly agree with

- The distinctions made between what’s academic dishonesty and what’s teamwork. I think it’s important that there is a clear line between the two, because of how huge its impact can be on our lives. There is not a lot of times where we’re reminded of what exactly academic dishonesty is, we’re only repeatedly told the consequences of doing it, so I appreciate having something that I can refer to.
- There’s a section on what to do if you arrive late. I never actually knew what the right thing to do was supposed to be.
- There’s also a section on how to use the bathroom which is great because I have had some teachers that made me scared to use the bathroom.

Things in the document that I strongly disagree with

- The length of the document. It’s the internet, I am physically incapable of reading more than a paragraph of text at a time (jk, in case it wasn’t clear, that’s a joke, also that would make me a hypocrite because of what .
- Telepathy is also not a rare ability… if you know where to look
- I don’t think the color-coding is done properly. I feel like it’s just there to add some color. I think the larger titles should be green, and the smaller titles should be blue or something like that. Or maybe the how to succeed section is green, and the academic dishonesty section is red.
- The citation for “some people think more productively in company” could be much better. First of all, I don’t think a citation needs to exist as the statement isn’t that outlandish. Secondly, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator does not provide good evidence for the statement because as the page itself states, the “facts” provided here are based off of speculation, and also at the bottom of the page is a link to tell you that the test is meaningless. Lastly, I was promised a discussion and I got a wikipedia page. It’s a huge letdown.
- On page 11, the title “instructor’s” doesn’t really fit what the section’s really about
- There should be a section on how to title homework because I don’t know how to title this homework.
